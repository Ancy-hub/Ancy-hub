## 👋 Hey there, I’m Ancy

A backend-focused engineer with strong testing and framework design experience.
Currently learning **Go**, exploring **AWS**, and building small systems to understand how things actually work.

Here’s a **developer-leaning rewrite** of that section while keeping your vibe:

### 🖥️ System Logs (Human Edition)

🌱 Leveling up: Go fundamentals + AWS basics
🧪 Debug philosophy: logs → more logs → it was a typo

👩‍💻 Code + test architecture:
✅ Write tests like production code
✅ Build frameworks, not just test cases
❌ Sometimes test the test framework

🐹 Go arc:
✅ Compiles successfully
❌ Goroutines (terms under negotiation)

☁️ AWS phase:
✅ Can launch a service
❌ Still triple-checking regions like exam questions
